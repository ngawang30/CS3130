# Lab#5 Project Description

## Problem  
Read from a csv file of spotify songs form the past week.  Order the data for each week and build a binary search tree.  Also, make a method called subset which returns a range of strings from the song list.

## Solution
1) Using the scanner, the CSV file was read into a double array, the first index represnting the week and the second index.  
2) The double array was ordered alphabetically.
3) This double array is written to a file using printstream.
4) The double array was used to create a binary search tree.
5) The method subSet was created to traverse the binary search tree for a range of String.
6) The results of the subSet method is reported in the subSetDemo.txt
