# Lab#6 Project Description

## Problem  
Build a grade calculator that also allows you to calculate what grades you need on unassigned assignements to get the desired grade.

## Solution
1) Scan in each assignment while asking the user for their grade for each assignment.
2) Create a method to display the grades cleanly.  (The toString method).
3) Get an array of the ungraded assignments from the general grade array.
4) Order the array of ungraded assignments by points.
5) Check if the desired grade is possible, and if so, what must they get on each assignment to get said grade.
6) Report.
