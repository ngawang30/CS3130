# Lab#3 Project Description

## Problem  
Read from a Spotify CSV text file and generate a linked list of the ordered top 200 artists, making sure that the linked list contains no repeating artists.

## Solution
1) Using the scanner, the CSV file was read into an array.  However, additional steps were required to remove repeating artists.  
2) An insertion sort method was written and used to order the array.
3) The array was then used to make a linked list.
4) A printstream was used to read through the linked list into a file.
