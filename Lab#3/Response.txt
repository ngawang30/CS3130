	What I enjoyed learning the most came from the science forward video where they discussed a brief description of ecology.  Most notably, of how initially, the field of ecology disregarded humans and exclusively studied in natural environments.  This, of course, has changed as the video went on about urban ecology which studies the effect of human artifacts like the massive skyscrapers and other building projects on the animals the live in proximity.
	 In todays class, I hope we go further into urban ecology because, as the Bozeman science video said, humans are a keystone species as we can greatly improve or hurt the surrounding ecosystems within which we reside.  It would also be interesting to learn about other keystone species, excluding the ones in the videos, to observe the drastic effect they have in the ecosystems.
