# Lab#4 Project Description

## Problem  
Read from multiple csv files of spotify songs for the past fiscal months.  Order the data for each week and build a playlist queue from the data.  Also, make a list for the recently listened songs.

## Solution
1) Using the scanner, the CSV file was read into a double array, the first index represnting the week and the second index.  
2) The double array was ordered alphabetically for each week.
3) This double array is written to a file using printstream.
4) A new single array is created for all the songs.  Duplicates are removed and the list is ordered.
